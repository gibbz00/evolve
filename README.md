# Features

# Installation

1. Make sure that an internet conneciton is set up.

I would recommend `wifi-menu` for wireless networks, mostly for it's ease of use. 

2. Download the setup and its helper files, and make the script executable. 

`$ curl --location <url>/evolve.zip | zip -d evolve`
`$ chmod +x evolve/setup.sh`

3. Inspect files and if necesarry, modify to you liking.

4. Run setup scripts. *.gui is a extension of *.tui. GUI system must in other words run both setup scripts.  

TUI (headless) only: 

`$ sh ./evolve/setup.tui.sh`

GUI:

`$ sh ./evolve/setup.tui.sh`
`$ sh ./evolve/setup.gui.sh`
