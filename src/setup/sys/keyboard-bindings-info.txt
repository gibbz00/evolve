Goal: 
  swap escape and capslock
  swap leftctrl and leftalt

Changes the hw.bin that is used to modify keyboard scancode to keycode translation
Done at the hw.bin level to apply behaviour to both consoles and display servers

POTENTIAL IMPPROVEMENT: change to using the showkey(1) setkeycodes(8) API instead of this evtest, evdev-descrribe, udevrules, systemd-hwdb fuckfest

Takeaways:
* Scan codes for both USB devices and AT keyboards are standardized,
      should work for all keyboards that fall the two categories 
* Scan codes are matched with lowercase counterparts to key code definitions in
      /usr/include/linux/input-event-codes.h
* Standard USB keyboard scan codes:
  (taken with evtest program)
      700e2 - leftalt
      700e0 - leftctrl   
      70039 - capslock
      70029 - escape
* Standard AT keyboard scan codes:
  (
       taken from the column 'set 1' of table in section 10.6 from: 
       https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/kbd/scancodes-10.html
   ) 
      38 - leftalt
      1d - leftctrl
      3a - capslock
      01 - escape
